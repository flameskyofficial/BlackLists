# BlackLists
The admins of FlameSky noticed when FlameSky was developed, that it was really difficult to find lists of links or urls, which will help developers build various kind of blocking and/or security software. Inorder to help developers, FlameSky decided to compile a list of websites which allegedly are reported to contain a certain kind of content. This list is in public domain. We welcome all developers and netizens to contribute.

# Organization
The list is organized by categories.

#Contents

Just because FlameSky has a category does not necessarily mean it endorses the blocking of such categories of website
